# Interactive Viewers from Latest 3D Gaussian Splatting Repos

After reviewing the 8 repositories found in the last 24 hours, **none of them appear to be interactive viewers or creative presentation tools**.

## Analysis:

Most of these repositories fall into excluded categories:

- **Training/Research Code**: Multiple repos by DhrubaAdhikary appear to be academic implementations (3D-Gaussian-Splatting-Code, 2D_Gaussian_Splatting_Geometrically_Accurate_Radiance_Field_Reconstruction)
- **Object Insertion Tools**: Two repos focused on object insertion functionality, likely backend processing tools
- **Academic Paper Websites**: XDimLab/freefix appears to be a project website for a research paper
- **Pipeline Tools**: ch1bo/drone-reconstruction is described as a "pipeline" for processing drone footage, suggesting a processing tool rather than an interactive viewer
- **Incomplete/Empty Projects**: Several repos have no description or appear to be early-stage projects (3DGS-Matte, LumiAR)

## Notable Mention:

**hyeonnmin/LumiAR** has the most promising description ("Image-to-3D Reconstruction for AR using 3D Gaussian Splatting") and could potentially include AR viewing capabilities, but without code or further documentation visible, it's unclear if it includes an interactive viewer component.
