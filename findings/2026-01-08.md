# 3D Gaussian Splatting Interactive Viewers - Daily Report

## Summary

**None of the repositories found in the last 24 hours appear to be interactive viewers or creative presentation tools.**

## Analysis of Found Repositories

### leon2000-ai/RoSplat
- **URL**: https://github.com/leon2000-ai/RoSplat
- **Assessment**: This appears to be a research implementation focused on "Lightweight Contour-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting" for plant imaging applications. Despite the promising description, this seems to be an academic/research project rather than an interactive viewer tool.

### htmlk-first/3DGS
- **URL**: https://github.com/htmlk-first/3DGS
- **Assessment**: Contains Jupyter Notebook files but lacks description or clear indication of being a viewer application. Appears to be experimental or educational code rather than a presentation tool.

## Conclusion

Today's findings consist primarily of research-oriented repositories without interactive viewer components. The 3D Gaussian Splatting ecosystem continues to see research development, but no new creative presentation tools or web-based viewers were identified in this 24-hour period.
