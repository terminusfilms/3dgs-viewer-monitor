## Interactive 3D Gaussian Splatting Viewers - Daily Report

**No interactive viewers found today.**

The repository discovered in the last 24 hours:

- **laliwang/PIGS** - This is an academic paper implementation focused on "Planar-Instance Gaussian Splatting Leveraging Planar Structural Priors." It appears to be research/training code for improving 3D Gaussian Splatting with planar structural constraints, not an interactive viewer or presentation tool.

All repositories found today fall into the excluded categories (academic implementations, research code). No web-based viewers, interactive tools, or creative presentation applications were identified.
