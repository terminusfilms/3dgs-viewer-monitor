## Claude's Analysis

Based on the provided repositories, **only one appears to be an interactive viewer or creative presentation tool**:

## Interactive Viewer Projects

### 1. [hungyanghsu/rrgt-ar-3dgs](https://github.com/hungyanghsu/rrgt-ar-3dgs)

**What makes it interesting:**
- Appears to be an AR (Augmented Reality) application using 3D Gaussian Splatting
- The name suggests it's specifically designed for viewing "Nisaetus nipalensis" (Mountain Hawk-Eagle) in AR
- Combines cutting-edge 3DGS technology with AR presentation, which is a relatively novel approach

**Technology Stack:**
- JavaScript (web-based AR implementation)
- Likely uses WebXR or similar AR frameworks for browser-based augmented reality

---

## Excluded Projects

The other repositories don't qualify as interactive viewers:

- **Miraclelzk/Ortho-3dgs** - Research framework for orthophoto generation (backend processing)
- **arnav-jagtap-iitgn/Depth-Guided-3D-Reconstruction** - Learning project focused on training implementation
- **yangpaimeng/3dgs_data** - Data repository (Python-based, no description)
- **WendyeeWang/3dgs-alpha-blending** - HTML project with no description, unclear purpose but likely experimental/research

**Note:** Most of these repositories are very new (0-1 stars) and may still be in early development stages, so their full capabilities might not yet be apparent from the repository descriptions alone.
