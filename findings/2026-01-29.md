# Interactive 3D Gaussian Splatting Viewers (Last 24 Hours)

## Found Interactive Viewers

### 1. **ReconWorldLab/gdgs**
- **URL**: https://github.com/ReconWorldLab/gdgs
- **What makes it interesting**: This is a plugin that brings Gaussian Splatting directly into the Godot 4 game engine, which is a unique approach for creating interactive 3D experiences. This could enable game developers to incorporate photorealistic Gaussian Splat models into playable games and interactive applications.
- **Technology Stack**: Godot 4 (C#/GDScript game engine plugin)

### 2. **FullToker/my_antimatter15_splat**
- **URL**: https://github.com/FullToker/my_antimatter15_splat
- **What makes it interesting**: A modification of the popular antimatter15 WebGL splat viewer, suggesting custom improvements or features beyond the original web-based viewer. While it's based on existing code, the fact that it's a modification implies new functionality or enhancements.
- **Technology Stack**: JavaScript, WebGL

## Summary

2 out of 6 repositories appear to be interactive viewers or creative presentation tools. The Godot plugin is particularly noteworthy as it represents a novel integration approach for game engines, while the antimatter15 modification suggests continued community innovation on web-based viewing experiences.

The remaining repositories appear to be research implementations (FreeFix, 3Dream), training setups (Video-3DGS-Setup), or basic forks without clear viewer components.
