# 3DGS Viewer Monitor - 2026-01-17

## Summary

- **Repos scanned**: 3
- **Search queries**: gaussian splatting, 3dgs, gsplat viewer, splat viewer, 3d gaussian splat, gaussian splat viewer
- **Time range**: Last 24 hours

## Claude's Analysis

Based on the GitHub repos found in the last 24 hours, here's the analysis for interactive viewers and creative presentation tools:

## Interactive Viewers Found

### **chektien/webgsbench**
**URL:** https://github.com/chektien/webgsbench

**What makes it interesting:**
- This appears to be a web-based benchmarking tool for 3D Gaussian Splatting, which likely includes interactive viewer components for performance testing and comparison
- Being targeted for "Web Deployment" suggests it has browser-based viewing capabilities
- Associated with SIGGRAPH Asia 2026, indicating it's cutting-edge research with practical web implementation

**Technology Stack:**
- TypeScript (primary language)
- Web-based deployment focus

---

## Non-Viewer Projects

The other two repositories don't appear to be interactive viewers:

- **Star4396/InitGaussian** - This is a research implementation focused on improving text-to-3D generation through better initialization schemes. It's primarily Python-based training/research code.

- **skuznetsov/crystal-gausplat** - While this combines 3D reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting and MASt3R for Apple Silicon, it appears to be more of a reconstruction pipeline rather than an interactive viewer tool.

## Summary

Only **1 out of 3** repositories appears to be an interactive viewer tool. The webgsbench project stands out as potentially offering web-based interactive capabilities for benchmarking Gaussian Splatting performance, which would require viewer functionality for practical use.
