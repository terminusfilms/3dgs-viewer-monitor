# 3D Gaussian Splatting Interactive Viewers - Daily Report

## Summary

**No interactive viewers found** in today's repositories.

## Repository Analysis

### Hexinator12/-Project-Mirror-The-Global-Digital-Twin
- **Type**: Conceptual/Planning Stage Project
- **Assessment**: While this project describes an ambitious vision for creating a global digital twin using 3D Gaussian Splatting with community-driven content creation, the repository appears to be in very early stages with no actual viewer implementation yet.
- **Status**: 0 stars, likely contains planning documents rather than functional code

---

*Note: Today's findings show more conceptual/planning phase projects rather than working interactive viewers. The 3D Gaussian Splatting ecosystem continues to be active, but implementation-ready viewer projects were not present in this 24-hour window.*

- **Created**: 2026-01-11
- **Topics**: None
- **Description**: A community-driven platform to build a 1:1 digital twin of the world. Using 3D Gaussian Splatting and Deep Learning, we turn smartphone videos into immersive 3D environments. Join our global "Clans" of coders and creators to map everything from local streets to hidden landmarks. Open-source, collaborative, and human-scale.
